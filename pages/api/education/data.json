    "text": " Don't confuse schooling with education. Education hasn't been started at the university and it hasn't finished after it. I would say I never eat the whole technology pie at once, just to keep up the hunger for later. I try to develop myself continuously, day by day and I always try to convince my teammates to try out new technologies, which is hard and uncomfortable, but inside our comfort zone, without sweat, technology ain't gonna improve. It only improves if a lot of people work very hard to make it better."
